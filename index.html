            I am passionate for dancing. I have been practicing salsa, hip hop, k-pop, and street dance since 2014. I have two adorble puppies, 
            a toy poodle (Wagner) and a stadard poodle (Bucky). Although they are much different in size, they grew up together and make a great
            pack. We are loving family. I can never spend time with them enough.</p>
